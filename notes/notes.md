### These are my notes for refactoring the rockies locator app
- The purpose for this repo is to start refactoring my rockies app. My hope is that I can make the project better with vue then come back again with vuex.
- I am going to attempt to work in complete features and work-in veautify.
- I will also be using waffle io to tack my progress and help keep me on task.
- Lets see how this goes. I also want to do wire framing and eventually ERD but first I will probably just stick with the API call so not database.
- Ok laid out the first wireframe in sketch
  - Going follow the waffle tracker and clean things up and push to github
### 7/31/2017 Monday
- Started out this morning getting everything laid out for the Headers and Footers
- There are some growing pains with vuetify but it is worth using to get through this. The code is ugly but it works and I can get it refactored again.
- Going to push this to github and then work on getting the button and the display then hopefully making API call after lunch.
